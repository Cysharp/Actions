# Reusable workflows

## clean-packagejson-branch

> [See workflow](https://github.com/Cysharp/Actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/clean-packagejson-branch.yaml)

Delete specic github branch. Mainly used for cleanup branch created by [update-packagejson](#update-packagejson) workflow. Action has following limitation to prevent accidental deletion.

1. Branch is NOT default branch.
2. Branch is created & commited by github-actions[bot].

**Sample usage**

```yaml
name: Build-Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  cleanup:
    uses: Cysharp/Actions/.github/workflows/clean-packagejson-branch.yaml@main
    with:
      branch: branch_name_to_delete
```

## create-release

> [See workflow](https://github.com/Cysharp/Actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-release.yaml)

Create GitHub Release, upload NuGet and upload artifact to release assets. Mainly used for NuGet and Unity release workflow.

Required secrets.

| SecretKey | When | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `NUGET_KEY` | `with.nuget-push` is true | This secret is required to push nupkg, snupkg to NuGet.org |

**Sample usage**

Create release only.

```yaml
name: Build-Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag:
        description: "tag: git tag you want create. (sample 1.0.0)"
        required: true
      dry-run:
        description: "dry_run: true will never create release/nuget."
        required: true
        default: false
        type: boolean

jobs:
  create-release:
    uses: Cysharp/Actions/.github/workflows/create-release.yaml@main
    with:
      commit-id: ''
      tag: ${{ inputs.tag }}
      dry-run: ${{ inputs.dry-run }} # if true, delete tag after Release creation & 60s later.
      nuget-push: false
      release-upload: false
    secrets: inherit
```

Change release name not to use `Ver.` prefix.

```yaml
name: Build-Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag:
        description: "tag: git tag you want create. (sample 1.0.0)"
        required: true
      dry-run:
        description: "dry_run: true will never create release/nuget."
        required: true
        default: false
        type: boolean

jobs:
  create-release:
    uses: Cysharp/Actions/.github/workflows/create-release.yaml@main
    with:
      commit-id: ''
      tag: ${{ inputs.tag }}
      dry-run: ${{ inputs.dry-run }} # if true, delete tag after Release creation & 60s later.
      nuget-push: false
      release-upload: false
      release-format: '{0}'
    secrets: inherit
```

Build .NET then create release. `create-release` will push nuget packages.

```yaml

        with:
          name: nuget
          path: ./Sandbox/publish
          retention-days: 1

  create-release:
    needs: [build-dotnet]
    uses: Cysharp/Actions/.github/workflows/create-release.yaml@main
    with:
      commit-id: ''
      tag: ${{ inputs.tag }}
      dry-run: ${{ inputs.dry-run }} # if true, delete tag after Release creation & 60s later.
      nuget-push: true
      release-upload: false
    secrets: inherit                 # to allow workflow to access NUGET_KEY secret
```

Build .NET and Unity, then create release. `create-release` will push nuget packages and upload unitypackage to release assets.

# Actions

## check-benchmarkable

> [See action](https://github.com/Cysharp/Actions/blob/main/.github/actions/check-benchmarkable/action.yaml)

Check if GitHub User is allow to run benchmark.
Mainly used for benchmark CI workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> This action is workaround for current `github.event.comment.author_association` inconsistence behavior.
> `github.event.comment.author_association` should return `OWNER`, `MEMBER` or `CORABORATOR` for organization member, however currently it returns `CONTRIBUTOR` even actor is Org member.
> It means `github.event.comment.author_association` can't be used to check if actor is Org member == "benchmark command allowed user" or not.
> This action checks if actor is Benchmark allowd by statically defined list, lol.

**sample usage**

```yaml
name: benchmark

jobs:
  # is actor is benchmarkable
  verify:
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || contains(github.event.comment.body, '/benchmark') }}
    outputs:
      is-benchmarkable: ${{ steps.check_actor.outputs.authorized }} # true or false
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - name: Check actor is benchmarkable
        uses: Cysharp/Actions/.github/actions/check-benchmarkable@main
        with:

  # run benchmark
  benchmark:
    needs: [verify]
    if: ${{ needs.verify.outputs.is-benchmarkable == 'true' }}
